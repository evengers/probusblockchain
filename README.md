Proof of concept for probus blockchain and cryptocurrency

a simple blockchain along with  links to cryptocurrency and blockchain references


Done:

1) very simple demonstration/example blockchain created with crypto blocks, hashing, proof of work
see ... a chain of blocks (linked togeter with hash values) https://probusblockchainpeer.web.app/#/

2) published to GitHub  ... related aggregator listing over 12,000 "cryptos" here: https://probuschain.web.app/#/

3) input/output data using external document store (Firestore from Google) instead of hard-code example 

4) google sheets portfolio of Blockchain and Crypto etfs 
5) 

Initial thoughts on To-Do (but given blockchain as service offerings not much point) :
 
- add ledger-style .xls to .json ?? for ease of ledger demo-use 

- add permissions

- add peer-to-peer compute with multi-node (i.e., multiple computers)
      - replication of data to peers  (commonly now called "distributed" in blockchain discussions)
      - communication of results

- add authentication / public & private key generation 

- demo "proof of stake", concensus ... or "notary" variation

CRIME

This week, the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) announced it confiscated $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency stolen during the 2016 hack of virtual currency exchange Bitfinex, and arrested two suspects attempting to launder the money. Officials said it was the largest financial seizure in the department’s history.
 
Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, both of New York City, were accused of conspiring to launder the proceeds of almost 120,000 bitcoin taken by a hacker who breached Bitfinex’s systems and grabbed the currency through 2,000 unauthorized transactions. They explained the bitcoin went to a digital wallet under Lichtenstein’s control, with some going into accounts owned by him and Morgan. Officials indicated they used search warrants to break into the accounts and collect 94,000 stolen bitcoin.
 
If convicted, Lichtenstein and Morgan face a maximum of 20 years in prison for money laundering and five years for conspiracy to defraud the U.S.
 
 
The August 2016 Bitfinex attack was one of the largest cryptocurrency crimes ever, and led to a 20% sell-off of Bitcoin at the time. The DOJ noted the total amount of the theft was $4.5 billion in present value.

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98788/how-is-data-in-a-blockchain-stored-structure-of-block-and-blockchain

" If designing your own blockchain, you obviously have a lot of leeway as to what goes into the data blocks, 
how they are stored and distributed, etc. The choice of networking and storage protocols are not what make it a blockchain.

So, back to your original question: what is a block? It's just a chunk of data.

How is it stored? However you like, but for Bitcoin, they are just chunks of data disseminated via a P2P network of nodes, 
and many nodes will store those chunks in a database on disk. 
In fact, there are several bitcoin implementations which store them in different ways! 
But they can all agree on what's valid, because of the blockchain. "
