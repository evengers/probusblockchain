# probusblockchain
Proof of concept for probus blockchain and cryptocurrency

a simple blockchain along with  links to cryptocurrency and blockchain references


Done:

1) very simple demonstration/example blockchain created with crypto blocks, hashing, proof of work
see ... a chain of blocks (linked togeter with hash values) https://probusblockchainpeer.web.app/#/

2) published to GitHub  ... related aggregator listing over 12,000 "cryptos" here: https://probuschain.web.app/#/

3) input/output data using external document store (Firestore from Google) instead of hard-code example 

4) google sheets portfolio of Blockchain and Crypto etfs 
5) 

Initial thoughts on To-Do (but given blockchain as service offerings not much point) :
 
- add ledger-style .xls to .json ?? for ease of ledger demo-use 

- add permissions

- add peer-to-peer compute with multi-node (i.e., multiple computers)
      - replication of data to peers  (commonly now called "distributed" in blockchain discussions)
      - communication of results

- add authentication / public & private key generation 

- demo "proof of stake", concensus ... or "notary" variation

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98788/how-is-data-in-a-blockchain-stored-structure-of-block-and-blockchain

" If designing your own blockchain, you obviously have a lot of leeway as to what goes into the data blocks, 
how they are stored and distributed, etc. The choice of networking and storage protocols are not what make it a blockchain.

So, back to your original question: what is a block? It's just a chunk of data.

How is it stored? However you like, but for Bitcoin, they are just chunks of data disseminated via a P2P network of nodes, 
and many nodes will store those chunks in a database on disk. 
In fact, there are several bitcoin implementations which store them in different ways! 
But they can all agree on what's valid, because of the blockchain. "
